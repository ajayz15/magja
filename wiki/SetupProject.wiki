=== Install Maven for Eclipse Plugin ===

On Eclipse, follow these instructions:

 # Select Help > Install New Software. This should display the "Install" dialog.
 # Paste the Update Site URL into the field named "Work with:" and press Enter. Pressing Enter should cause Eclipse to update list of available plugins and components.
 # Choose the component listed under m2eclipse: "Maven Integration for Eclipse (Required)".
 # Click Next. Eclipse will then check to see if there are any issues which would prevent a successful installation.
 # Click Next and agree to the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0.
 # Click Finish to begin the installation process. Eclipse will then download and install the necessary components.
 # Once the installation process is finished, Eclipse will ask you if you want to restart the IDE. It's strongly recommends that you restart your IDE after installing m2eclipse.
