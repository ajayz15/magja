# Magja on Github #

Hi everybody,

We are announcing the moving of Magja's project to Github.
One of the advantages of Github it's the social coding, it's allows us to be more collaborative, in addition to providing more intuitive tools focused on sharing code.

So, the new project's page is the following:
http://github.com/magja

If you are a Magja's member, please register on the Github (or not, if you already are member) and send us your username, so we can add you on the project there too.

Nice coding!
